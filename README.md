# Statistical Analysis on factors influencing Life Expectancy
## Project Goal
In this project, we are investigating the factors that are impacting the life expectency in 193 countries. We aim to develope a model that can predict the life expectancy using linear regression.

## Data Source:
This dataset has been obtained from the Kaggle Website : https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who <br>
Note from the Kaggle Website : The data was collected from WHO and United Nations website with the help of Deeksha Russell and Duan Wang.<br>
## Data Description:
The project relies on accuracy of data. The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries The data-sets are made available to public for the purpose of health data analysis. The data-set related to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries has been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic data was collected from United Nation website. Among all categories of health-related factors only those critical factors were chosen which are more representative. <br>
